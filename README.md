# Dividend Trend Prediction App

This Streamlit web application predicts whether a public company's dividend payout is likely to **increase**, **decrease**, or **stay the same** based on financial ratio analysis. The model leverages historical financial data and live updates from `yfinance` to generate real-time predictions for multiple industries.

## Features

- **Real-Time Dividend Prediction** using latest quarterly financials
- **Industry-Specific Models**: Financials, Consumer, Energy, and Others
- **Interactive Visuals**: Classification reports, confusion matrices, probability scores
- **Built-in Financial Ratio Calculator** for all key metrics
- **Model Training Code Access** with rationale and performance details


## Models Used

| Model    | Strengths |
|----------|-----------|
| CatBoost | Handles imbalanced datasets, robust for smaller tabular data |
| LightGBM + Voting Ensemble | Fast, memory-efficient; combined with Logistic Regression and Decision Tree |
| XGBoost  | High performance with strong regularization and feature handling |


## Financial Ratios Used

The model uses 16+ key financial ratios across:

- **Profitability**: ROE, ROA, Net Profit Margin, Gross Profit
- **Liquidity**: Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, Cash Ratio
- **Leverage**: D/E, Debt/EBITDA, Interest Coverage
- **Cash Flow**: FCF/OCF, OCF/LTD
- **Dividend Target**: DPR (Dividend Payout Ratio)


## Tech Stack

- `streamlit` for frontend UI
- `yfinance` for real-time data access
- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for data processing and visualizations
- `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `catboost`, `lightgbm` for modeling
- `openai` for GPT-powered natural language explanation


## Data Sources

- **Training Data**: WRDS / CRSP dataset (20 years of dividend and ratio history)
- **Live Testing**: Pulled dynamically from `yfinance` for any ticker
